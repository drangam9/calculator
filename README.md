# calculator
This is my first project in c#. A simple calculator app made using Visual Studio and Windows Forms Application.
It will get updated every once in a while as I plan on adding more features as I learn. 

Operations and other functonalities are yet to be added. (i guess it's not a proper calculator app yet if it just shows numbers in the 
textbox without doing any operations... Working on it!)

Note: Being my first time working with WFA and GitHub, things may look unorganized and chaotic, but it's part of my learning journey 
to become a better programmer :).
