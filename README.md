# calculator
This is my first project in c#. A simple calculator app made using Visual Studio and Windows Forms Application.
It will get updated every once in a while as I plan on adding more features as I learn.

Note: Being my first time working with WFA and GitHub, things may look unorganized and chaotic, but it's part of my learning journey 
to become a better programmer :).
